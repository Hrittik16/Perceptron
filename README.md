# Multilayer Perceptron

### This is a simple multilayer perceptron that can classify bmi of a person into healthy or unhealthy

#### BMI = Weight(Kgs) / Height<sup>2</sup>(m)

#### There are four categories: Underweight(<18.5 BMI), Healthy(18.5 - 24.9 BMI), Overweight(25.0 - 29.0 BMI) and Obese(>30.0 BMI)

#### Underweight, overweight and obese will be classified as unhealthy

#### A single perceptron is good for linear classification but when you combine bunch of these perceptrons into hidden layers they can learn to do non-linear classification. 
#### BMI classification is a non-linear problem because both underweight and obese are considered unhealthy. Their BMI lies on the two sides of healthy BMI range. So, a single line cannot classify healthy and unhealthy BMI range.
