# Perceptron

#### Building a simple perceptron that can classify bmi of a person into weight classes

### BMI = Weight(Kgs) / Height<sup>2</sup>(m)

#### A simple perceptron with no hidden layers can learn to classify bmi into 4 different weight classes: Underweight(<18.5 BMI), Healthy(18.5 - 24.9 BMI), Overweight(25.0 - 29.0 BMI) and Obese(>30.0 BMI)
